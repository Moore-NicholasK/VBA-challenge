# VBA Challenge
I used the slides, lectures and my notes from this bootcamp to complete the assignment.  I also used microsoft's guides, such as https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/language/concepts/getting-started/using-ifthenelse-statements, without copying code.  All code beside the below is original:
*LastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(ActiveSheet.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row from https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/last-row-column-vba/
*For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21918166/excel-vba-for-each-worksheet-loop
